## Digital Tech Tutorial Watson Studio Part I to V

This tutorial consists of 4 parts, you can start with part I or any other part, however, the necessary environment is set up in part I.<br>
[Part I - data visualization, preparation, and transformation](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio)<br>
[Part II - build and evaluate machine learning models by using the AutoAI](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-ii/)<br>
[Part III - graphically build and evaluate machine learning models by using the SPSS Modeler flow](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iii/)<br>
[Part IV - set up and run Jupyter Notebooks to develop a machine learning model](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iv/)

The 4 parts of this tutorial are based on the [Learning path: Getting started with Watson Studio](https://developer.ibm.com/series/learning-path-watson-studio/).

## Start the app

- Download the repository to start the app on your local machine
- Open `app.py` and enter your API-Key, URL, Space-ID and Deployment-ID
- Start a terminal at the folder that contains the file `app.py`, in this case the folder is digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-v
- You might have to install the WML client with the following command: `pip install watson-machine-learning-client-V4`
- You might also have to install requests with the following command: `pip install requests`
- Then start the app by typing: `python app.py`
- Insert some values and hit the predict button
